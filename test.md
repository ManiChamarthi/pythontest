Certainly, I understand your request. Here's an updated example of how you might structure your test cases in an Excel-like format, including columns for Root Cause Analysis and Recommendations & Communication in case the test case fails:

| **Test Case ID** | **Objective** | **Steps to Reproduce** | **Expected Result** | **Actual Result** | **Pass/Fail** | **Root Cause Analysis (if Fail)** | **Recommendations & Communication (if Fail)** |
|------------------|--------------|-----------------------|---------------------|-------------------|--------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| TC001 | Severity Comparison | 1. Identify common vulnerabilities with unique IDs.<br>2. Compare severity levels and CVSS scores. | Severity levels in Panaseer match severity levels in SNOW VR for common vulnerabilities. | | | | |
| TC002 | SLA Calculation | 1. Select vulnerabilities with defined SLAs from both sources.<br>2. Compare SLAs for common vulnerabilities. | SLAs for common vulnerabilities match between Panaseer and SNOW VR. | | | | |
| TC003 | Ownership Comparison | 1. Choose a sample of vulnerabilities with identified ownership.<br>2. Compare ownership details. | Ownership details match for common vulnerabilities between Panaseer and SNOW VR. | | | | |
| TC004 | Root Cause Analysis | 1. Identify vulnerabilities with significant differences in severity, SLA, or ownership.<br>2. Investigate root causes for discrepancies. | Clear understanding of reasons for disparities in certain vulnerabilities. | | | | |
| TC005 | Recommendations and Communication | 1. Based on findings, create recommendations for improving data consistency.<br>2. Share recommendations with stakeholders. | Recommendations provided for data alignment and consistency improvements. | | | | |
